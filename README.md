Time of Arrival Multi-lateration 

Implemented several multi-lateration estimators in following papers:

Linear Least Square I:
Linear Least Square II:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1583909

Weighted Linear Least Square:https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6697

2 Step Weighted Linear Least Square:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/301830

Grid Search

Constrained Weighted Linear Least Square:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1275684/

Cramer-Rao Lower Bound 

Newton-Raphson Iteration Nonlinear Method: See Steven Kay's Estimation Theory 

The variance of each estimator are plotted against CRLB at high SNR region
